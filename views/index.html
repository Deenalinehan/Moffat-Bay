            <p>Ahoy and welcome to the Cozy Cavern! Nestled by the seaside, we’ve been offering a peaceful and memorable stay since 1974. Our cozy bed and breakfast started when Hank and Heidi Richmond got married right here — in fact, it’s where they began their journey as innkeepers!</p>

            <p>Whether you're looking for a quiet getaway or an adventure by the sea, our charming retreat offers both comfort and character. Come unwind, enjoy the views, and create lasting memories with us.</p>

            <p><strong>Join us for a relaxing stay. We can’t wait to welcome you!</strong></p>
